# react-lullakidvid
Experimenting with reactfire

This is a project started by @sirkitree to help learn reactjs.

The basic idea is to create something where Lullabots can enter videos from youtube that are appropriate for their kids and rate them. Their kids can then use the website on any device to view 'approved' youtube videos.

## Goals of the project:
* learn react
* keep this front-end only so it can run on gh-pages
* K.I.S.S.
* keep some basic responsiveness (bootstrap) so that it can be used on devices
* trust your users, but limit them to Lullabot only (i.e. anyone can moderate)
* small iterations/commits so that other can learn as we go

## Development
* clone the project and just open index.html in your browser
* make sure there is an issue for any change you want to make
* create change through a pull request

## Note on Firebase
I'm currently using an unrestricted firebase account for storage. Please be kind. Authentication and restrictions will go into place in a future iteration.
